# Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Sample

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) Project**. It includes iOS and Android applications with a native UI and a module with code shared on iOS and Android.

## Features

This sample demonstrates basic KMM features:
* Using platform-specific APIs with the expect/actual mechanism (see `Platform.kt`)
* Tests for Shared Module (see `CalculatorTest.kt`, `iosTest.kt`, `androidTest.kt`)

## How to use

With the [KMM plugin for Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) you can run, test, and debug shared code on both platforms without switching IDEs. Run and debug the application by selecting the corresponding configuration in the **Run configuration** menu. Run and debug shared module tests by pressing the gutter icon on a test class or method.
