/**
 * RealmList is used to model one-to-many relationships in a [RealmObject].
 *
 * A RealmList has two modes: `managed` and `unmanaged`. In `managed` mode all objects are persisted
 * inside a Realm whereas in `unmanaged` mode it works as a normal [MutableList].
 *
 * Only Realm can create managed RealmLists. Managed RealmLists will automatically update their
 * content whenever the underlying Realm is updated. Said content can only be accessed using the
 * getter of a [RealmObject].
 *
 * Unmanaged RealmLists can be created by the user and can contain both managed and unmanaged
 * [RealmObject]s. This is useful when dealing with JSON deserializers like Gson or other frameworks
 * that inject values into a class. Unmanaged elements in a list can be added to a Realm using the
 * [MutableRealm.copyToRealm] method.
