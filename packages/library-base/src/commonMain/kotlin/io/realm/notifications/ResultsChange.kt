/**
 * This sealed interface describe the possible changes that can happen to a query results collection.
 *
 * The states are represented by the specific subclasses [InitialResults] and [UpdatedResults].
 *
 * Changes can thus be consumed in a number of ways:
 *
 * ```
 * // Variant 1: Switch on the sealed interface
 * realm.query<Person>().asFlow()
 *   .collect { it: ResultsChange<Person> ->
 *       when(result) {
 *          is InitialList -> setUIList(it.list)
 *          is UpdatedList -> updateUIList(it) // Android RecyclerView knows how to animate ranges
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 *
 * // Variant 2: Just pass on the list
 * realm.query<Person>().asFlow()
 *   .collect { it: ResultsChange<Person> ->
 *       handleChange(it.list)
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * When the list is updated, extra information is provided describing the changes from the previous
 * version. This information is formatted in a way that can be feed directly to drive animations on UI
 * components like `RecyclerView`. In order to access this information, the [ListChange] must be cast
 * to the appropriate subclass.
 *
 * ```
 * realm.query<Person>().asFlow()
 *   .collect { it: ListChange<Person> ->
 *       when(result) {
 *          is InitialList -> setList(it.list)
 *          is UpdatedList -> { // Automatic cast to UpdatedList
 *              updateList(
 *                  it.list,
 *                  it.deletionRanges,
 *                  it.insertionRanges,
 *                  it.changeRanges
 *             )
 *          }
 *          is DeletedList -> deleteList(it.list)
 *       }
 *   }
