/**
 * Defines a collection of linking objects that represents the inverse relationship between two Realm
 * models. Any direct relationship, one-to-one or one-to-many, can be reversed by linking objects.
 *
 * You cannot directly add or remove items from a linking objects collection. The collection automatically
 * updates itself when relationships are changed.
 *
 * Linking objects on a one-to-one relationship:
 *
 * ```
 * class Town {
 *  var county: County? = null
 * }
 *
 * class County {
 *  val towns: RealmResults<Town> by linkingObjects(Town::county)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Linking objects on a one-to-many relationship:
 *
 * ```
 * class Parent {
 *  var children: List<Child>? = null
 * }
 *
 * class Child {
 *  val parents: RealmResults<Parent> by linkingObjects(Parent::children)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Querying inverse relationship is like querying any [RealmResults]. This means that an inverse
 * relationship cannot be null but it can be empty (length is 0). It is possible to query fields
 * in the class containing the linkingObjects field. This is equivalent to link queries.
 *
 * Because Realm lists allow duplicate elements, linking objects might contain duplicate references
 * when the target property is a Realm list and contains multiple references to the same object.
 *
 * @param T type of object that references the model.
 * @param targetProperty property that references the model.
 * @return delegate for the linking objects collection.
