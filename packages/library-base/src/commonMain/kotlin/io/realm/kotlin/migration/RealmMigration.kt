 * The automatic schema migration will not change data for objects and properties that have not

 * will be initialized with default values in the migrated realm and data has to be moved manually.
 * The [migrate] callback provides access to the previous and the migrated realm through a dynamic
 * (string based) API that allow such transformations. Examples are:
 * - Merging, transforming and splitting property values
 * - Renaming a property
 * - Changing type of a property
 *
 * Transformation like these can be done through [MigrationContext.enumerate] that iterates
 * all objects of a certain type and provides access to the old and new instance of an object. Some
 * example are given in the documentation of [MigrationContext.enumerate].
