/**
 * RealmSet is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.
 *
 * Similarly to [RealmList]s, a RealmSet can operate in `managed` and `unmanaged` modes. In
 * managed mode a RealmSet persists all its contents inside a realm whereas in unmanaged mode
 * it functions like a [MutableSet].
 *
 * Managed RealmSets can only be created by Realm and will automatically update their content
 * whenever the underlying Realm is updated. Managed RealmSets can only be accessed using the getter
 * that points to a RealmSet field of a [RealmObject].
 *
 * @param E the type of elements contained in the RealmSet.
