//  - Realms, Results and Lists are queryable, but might not be needed as an interface
//    dependent on how the final API is going to look like.
//  - Query could alternatively be separated into builder to await constructing new results until
//    actually executing the query
//  https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/206
