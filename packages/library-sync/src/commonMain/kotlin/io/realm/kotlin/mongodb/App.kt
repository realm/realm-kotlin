 * An **App** is the main client-side entry point for interacting with an **Atlas App Services
 * Application**.
 *
 * The **App** can be used to:
 * - Register and authenticate users.
 * - Synchronize data between the local device and Atlas using Device Sync.
 *
 * This can be done as shown below:
 *
 * ```
 *     class MyApplication {
 *         val app: App = App.create("<APP_ID>")
 *         val realm: Realm
 *
 *         init {
