 * A synced realm may need to be reset because the Device Sync encountered an error and had to be
 * restored from a backup, or because it has been too long since the client connected to the server
 * so the server has rotated the logs.
 *
 * The Client Reset thus occurs because the server does not have all the information required to
 * bring the client fully up to date.
 *
 * The manual reset process is as follows: the local copy of the realm is copied into a recovery
 * directory for safekeeping and then deleted from the original location. The next time the realm
 * for that URL is opened it will automatically be re-downloaded from Atlas, and can be used as
 * usual.
 *
 * Data written to the realm after the local copy of itself diverged from the backup remote copy
 * will be present in the local recovery copy of the Realm file. The re-downloaded realm will
 * initially contain only the data present at the time the realm was backed up on the server.
 *
 * The client reset process can be initiated in one of two ways:
 *
 *  1. Run [ClientResetRequiredException.executeClientReset] manually. All Realm instances must be
 *  closed before this method is called.
 *
 *  2. If Client Reset isn't executed manually, it will automatically be carried out the next time
 *  all Realm instances have been closed and re-opened. This will most likely be when the app is
 *  restarted.
 *
 * **WARNING:**
 * Any writes to the Realm file between this callback and Client Reset has been executed, will not
 * be synchronized to Atlas. Those changes will only be present in the backed up file. It is
 * therefore recommended to close all open Realm instances as soon as possible.
