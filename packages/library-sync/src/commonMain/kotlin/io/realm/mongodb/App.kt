/**
 * An **App** is the main client-side entry point for interacting with a **MongoDB Realm App**.
 *
 * The **App** can be used to:
 * - Register and authenticate users.
 * - Synchronize data between the local device and a backend Realm App with synchronized realms.
 *
 * To create an app that is linked with a remote **Realm App**, initialize Realm and configure the
 * **App** as shown below:
 *
 * ```
 *     class MyRealmAppClass {
 *         val app: App = App.create(<APP_ID>)
 *         val realm: Realm
 *
 *         init {
 *              realm = runBlocking {
 *                  val user = app.login(Credentials.anonymous())
 *                  val config = SyncConfiguration.Builder(
 *                      user = user,
 *                      partitionValue = "my-partition"
 *                      schema = setOf(YourRealmObject::class),
 *                  ).build()
 *
 *                  Realm.open(config)
 *              }
 *         }
