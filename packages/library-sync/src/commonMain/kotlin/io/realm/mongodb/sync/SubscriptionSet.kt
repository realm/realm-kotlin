/**
 * A subscription set is an immutable view of all current [Subscription]s for a given
 * Realm that has been configured for Flexible Sync.
 *
 * Flexible Sync is a way of defining which data gets synchronized to and from the device using
 * [RealmQuery]s. The query and its metadata are represented by a [Subscription].
 *
 * A subscription set thus defines all the data that is available to the device and being
 * synchronized with the server. If the subscription set encounters an error, e.g. by containing an
 * invalid query, the entire subscription set will enter an [SubscriptionSetState.ERROR]
 * state, and no synchronization will happen until the error has been fixed.
 *
 * If a subscription is removed, so is the corresponding data, but it is only removed from the
 * device. It isn't deleted on the server.
 *
 * It is possible to modify a subscription set while offline, but a modification isn't
 * accepted by the server before [BaseSubscriptionSet.state] returns
 * [SubscriptionSetState.COMPLETE], which requires that the device has been online.
 *
 * It is possible to wait for the subscription set to be synchronized with the server by using
 * [waitForSynchronization].
