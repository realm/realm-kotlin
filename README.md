Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Kotlin SDK for Realm, which runs on Kotlin Multiplatform and Android.

# Quick Startup Video

### Define your model

```Kotlin
@RealmObject
class Person : RealmModel {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
}
```
Other primitive types are supported: `Char`, `Byte`, `Short`, `Long`, `Boolean`, `Float`, `Double`

### Define your schema and open a Realm
```Kotlin
@RealmModule(Person::class)
class MySchema

val configuration = RealmConfiguration.Builder(schema = MySchema()).build()
var realm: Realm = Realm.open(configuration)
```

### Write Transaction 
```Kotlin
realm.beginTransaction()
// create a new persisted instance
val person = realm.create(Person::class).apply {
        name = "Foo"
        age = 42
}
realm.commitTransaction()
```

### Query
- Querying all objects of a certain type.

```Kotlin
val objects: RealmResults<Person> = realm.objects(Person::class)
```
- Querying using a predicate.

```Kotlin
val objects: RealmResults<Person> =
            realm.objects(Person::class).query("name == $0", "Foo")
```

# Developer Preview

The Realm Kotlin SDK is in Developer Preview. All API's might change without warning and no guarantees are given about stability. *Do not use in production*.  

## Design documents

The public API of the SDK has not been finalized. Design discussions will happen in both Google Doc and this Github repository. Most bigger features will first undergo a design process that might not involve code. These design documents can be found using the following links:

* [Intial Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10adRFquingm_JgyjDhUzcYXIDJsDG2A1ldFw53GSVJQ/edit)
* [API Design Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSPNO95wZAAojYlFwshSpLiuEu9ZqXptO58RDoPHKNc/edit)


# How to build:

## Prerequisits

- Swig. On Mac this can be installed using Homebrew: `brew install swig`.

## Commands to build

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd test
./gradlew assemble
```
In Android Studio open the `test` project, which will open also the `realm-library` and the compiler projects


# Using Snapshots

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [JFrog OSS](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/kotlin/gradle-plugin/)

```
// Global build.gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
        }
        maven {
            url 'https://dl.bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-dev'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.realm.kotlin:plugin-gradle:<VERSION>'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
        }
        maven {
            url 'https://dl.bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-dev'
        }
    }
}
```

See [Config.kt](buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Config.kt#L2txt) for the latest version number.


# Repository Guidelines

## Branch Strategy

We have three branches for shared development: `master`, `releases` and `next-major`. Tagged releases are only made from `releases`.

`master`:

* Target branch for new features.
* Cotains the latest publishable state of the SDK.
* [SNAPSHOT releases](#using-snapshots) are being created for every commit.

`releases`:

* All tagged releases are made from this branch.
* Target branch for bug fixes.
* Every commit should be merged back to master `master`.
* Minor changes (e.g. to documentation, tests, and the build system) may not affect end users but should still be merged to `releases` to avoid diverging too far from `master` and to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts.

`next-major`:

* Target branch for breaking changes that would result in a major version bump.


Note: We currently only have the `master` branch, as no tagged releases have been made yet.

## Code Style

We use the offical [style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) from Kotlin which is enforced using [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) and [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt).

```sh
# Call from root folder to check if code is compliant.
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew detekt

# Call from root folder to automatically format all Kotlin code according to the code style rules.
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

Note: ktlint does not allow group imports using `.*`. You can configure IntelliJ to disallow this by going to preferences `Editor > Code Style > Kotlin > Imports` and select "Use single name imports".

## Defining dependencies

All dependency versions and other constants we might want to share between projects are defined inside the file 
`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Config.kt`. Any new dependencies should be added to this file as well, so we only have one
location for these.

## Contributing Enhancements

We love contributions to Realm! If you'd like to contribute code, documentation, or any other improvements, please [file a Pull Request](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/pulls) on our GitHub repository. Make sure to accept our [CLA](#CLA)!

### CLA

Realm welcomes all contributions! The only requirement we have is that, like many other projects, we need to have a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) (CLA) in place before we can accept any external code. Our own CLA is a modified version of the Apache Software Foundationâ€™s CLA.

[Please submit your CLA electronically using our Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQ9ROFaTu9pyrmPhXc-dEnLD84DbLuT_-tPNZDOL9J10tOKQ/viewform) so we can accept your submissions. The GitHub username you file there will need to match that of your Pull Requests. If you have any questions or cannot file the CLA electronically, you can email help@realm.io.


# Samples

## Kotlin Multiplatform Sample

The folder `examples/kmm-sample` contains an example showing how to use Realm in a multiplatform
project, sharing code for using Realm in the `shared` module. The project is based on
`https://github.com/Kotlin/kmm-sample`.
