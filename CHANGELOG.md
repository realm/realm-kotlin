* [Sync] It is now possible to create multiple anonymous users by specifying `Credentials.anonymous(reuseExisting = false)` when logging in to an App.

### Fixed
* `Realm.deleteRealm(config)` would throw an exception if the file didn't exist.
* Returning deleted objects from `Realm.write` and `Realm.writeBlocking` threw a non-sensical `NullPointerException`. Returning such a value is not allowed and now throws an `IllegalStateException`. (Issue [#965](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/965))

* Fixed crash present on release-mode apps using Sync due to missing Proguard exception for `ResponseCallback`.
* The compiler plugin did not set the generic parameter correctly for an internal field inside model classes. This could result in other libraries that operated on the source code throwing an error of the type: `undeclared type variable: T`. (Issue [#901](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/901))
* String read from a realm was mistakenly treated as zero-terminated, resulting in strings with `\0`-characters to be truncated when read. Inserting data worked correctly. (Issue [#911](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/911))
* [Sync] Fix internal ordering of `EmailPasswordAuth.resetPassword(...)` arguments. (Issue [#885](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/885))

## 1.0.0 (2022-06-07)

### Breaking Changes
* Move all classes from package `io.realm` to `io.realm.kotlin`. This allows Realm Java and Realm Kotlin to be included in the same app without having class name conflicts. *WARNING:* While both libraries can be configured to open the same file, doing so concurrently is currently not supported and can lead to corrupted realm files.
* Updated default behavior for implicit import APIs (realm objects setters and list add/insert/set-operations) to update existing objects with similar primary key instead of throwing. (Issue [#849](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/849))
* Introduced `BaseRealmObject` as base interface of `RealmObject` and `DynamicRealmObject` to prepare for future embedded object support.
  * Most APIs accepts `BaseRealmObject` instead of `RealmObject`.
  * `DynamicRealmObject` no longer implements `RealmObject` but only `BaseRealmObject`
  * Besides the changes of base class of `DynamicRealmObject`, this should not require and code changes.

  * Moved `BaseRealmObject`, `RealmObject`, `EmbeddedObject`, `RealmList`, `RealmInstant` and `ObjectId` from `io.realm` to `io.realm.kotlin.types`
* Moved `RealmResults` from `io.realm` to `io.realm.kotlin.query`
* Reworked API for dynamic objects.
  * Support for unmanaged dynamic objects through `DynamicMutableRealmObject.create()`.
  * Replaced `DynamicMutableRealm.create()` with `DynamicMutableRealm.copyToRealm()` similar to `MutableRealm.copyToRealm()`.
* Moved `io.realm.MutableRealm.UpdatePolicy` to top-level class `io.realm.kotlin.UpdatePolicy` as it now also applies to `DynamicMutableRealm.copyToRealm()`.
* Deleted `Queryable`-interface and removed it from `RealmResults`.
* Moved extension methods on `BaseRealmObject`, `MutableRealm`, `TypedRealm`, `Realm` and `Iterable` from `io.realm` to `io.realm.kotlin.ext`
* Moved `io.realm.MutableRealm.UpdatePolicy` to top-level class `io.realm.UpdatePolicy` as it now also applies to `DynamicMutableRealm.copyToRealm()`
* All exceptions from Realm now has `RealmException` as their base class instead of `RealmCoreException` or `Exception`.
* Aligned factory methods naming. (Issue [#835](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/835))
  * Renamed `RealmConfiguration.with(...)` to `RealmConfiguration.create(...)`
  * Renamed `SyncConfiguration.with(...)` to `SyncConfiguration.create(...)`
  * Renamed `RealmInstant.fromEpochSeconds(...)` to `RealmInstant.from(...)`
* Reduced `DynamicMutableRealm` APIs (`copyToRealm()` and `findLatest()`) to only allow import and lookup of `DynamicRealmObject`s.

### Enhancements
* [Sync] Support for Flexible Sync through `Realm.subscriptions`. (Issue [#824](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/pull/824))
* [Sync] Added support for `ObjectId` ([#652](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/652)). `ObjectId` can be used as a primary key in model definition.
* [Sync] Support for `SyncConfiguration.Builder.InitialData()`. (Issue [#422](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/422))
* [Sync] Support for `SyncConfiguration.Builder.initialSubscriptions()`. (Issue [#831](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/831))
* [Sync] Support for `SyncConfiguration.Builder.waitForInitialRemoteData()`. (Issue [#821](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/821))
* [Sync] Support for accessing and controlling the session state through `SyncSession.state`, `SyncSession.pause()` and `SyncSession.resume()`.
* [Sync] Added `SyncConfiguration.syncClientResetStrategy` which enables support for client reset via `DiscardUnsyncedChangesStrategy` for partition-based realms and `ManuallyRecoverUnsyncedChangesStrategy` for Flexible Sync realms.
* [Sync] Support `ObjectId` as a partition key.
* Support for embedded objects. (Issue [#551](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/551))
* Support for `RealmConfiguration.Builder.initialData()`. (Issue [#579](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/579))
* Preparing the compiler plugin to be compatible with Kotlin `1.7.0-RC`. (Issue [#843](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/843))
* Added `AppConfiguration.create(...)` as convenience method for `AppConfiguration.Builder(...).build()` (Issue [#835](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/835))

### Fixed
* Fix missing symbol (`___bid_IDEC_glbround`) on Apple silicon

* A better error message if the Realm plugin was not applied to the module containing model classes. (Issue [#676](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/676))
* A better error message if a class is used that is not part of the schema. (Issue [#680](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/680))
* Add support for fine-grained notification on Realm instances. `Realm.asFlow()` yields `RealmChange` that represent the `InitialRealm` or `UpdatedRealm` states.
* Add support for fine-grained notification on Realm objects. `RealmObject.asFlow()` yields `ObjectChange` that represent the `InitialObject`, `UpdatedObject` or `DeletedObject` states.
* Add support for fine-grained notification on Realm lists. `RealmList.asFlow()` yields `ListChange` that represent the `InitialList`, `UpdatedList` or `DeletedList` states.
* Add support for fine-grained notifications on Realm query results. `RealmResults.asFlow()` yields `ResultsChange` that represent the `InitialResults` or `UpdatedResults` states.
* Add support for fine-grained notifications on `RealmSingleQuery`. `RealmSingleQuery.asFlow()` yields `SingleQueryChange` that represent the `PendingObject`, `InitialObject`, `UpdatedObject` or `DeletedObject` states.
* Add support for data migration as part of an automatic schema upgrade through `RealmConfiguration.Builder.migration(RealmMigration)` (Issue [#87](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/87))
* Added ability to delete objects specified by a `RealmQuery` or `RealmResults` through `MutableRealm.delete(...)` and `DynamicMutableRealm.delete(...).
* Add support for updating existing objects through `copyToRealm`. This requires them having a primary key. (Issue [#564](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/564))
* Added `Realm.deleteRealm(RealmConfiguration)` function that deletes the Realm files from the filesystem (Issue [#95](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/95)).

* `RealmConfiguration.path` should report the full Realm path. (Issue ([#605](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/605)).
* Support multiple constructors in model definition (one zero arg constructor is required though). (Issue ([#184](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/184)).
* Boolean argument substitution in queries on iOS/macOS would crash the query. (Issue [#691](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/691))
* Support 32-bit Android (x86 and armeabi-v7a). (Issue ([#109](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/109)).

## 0.6.0 (2021-10-15)

### Breaking Changes
* Rename library dependency from `io.realm.kotlin:library:<VERSION>` to `io.realm.kotlin:library-base:<VERSION>`
* Abstracted public API into interfaces. The interfaces have kept the name of the previous classes so only differences are:
  - Opening a realm: `Realm(configuration)` has changed to `Realm.open(configuration)`
  - Easy construction of simple configurations: `RealmConfiguration(schema = ...)` has changed to `RealmConfiguration.with(schema = ...)`
  - Instantiating a `RealmList` is now done through `realmListOf(...)` or by `Iterable<T>.toRealmList()`
* Make argument to `findLatest` non-nullable: `MutableRealm.findLatest(obj: T?): T?` has changed to `MutableRealm.findLatest(obj: T): T?`
* Allow query arguments to be `null`: `RealmResult.query(query: String = "TRUEPREDICATE", vararg args: Any): RealmResults<T>` has change to `RealmResult.query(query: String = "TRUEPREDICATE", vararg args: Any?): RealmResults<T>`
* Moved `objects(KClass<T>)` and `<reified T> objects()` methods from `BaseRealm` to `TypedRealm`
* Changed `RealmObject.version` into method `RealmObject.version()`.
* Replaced `RuntimeException`s by the explicit exceptions: `IllegalArgumentException`, `IllegalStateException` and `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* Throw `Error` an unrecoverable Realm problem happen in the underlying storage engine.
* Removed optional arguments to `RealmConfiguration.with(...)` and `RealmConfiguration.Builder(...)`. Name and path can now only be set through the builder methods.

### Enhancements
* Add support for [JVM target](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/62) supported platforms are: Linux (since Centos7 x86_64), Windows (since 8.1 x86_64) and Macos (x86_64).
* Added support for marking a field as indexed with `@Index`

### Fixed
* Fixed null pointer exceptions when returning an unmanaged object from `MutableRealm.write/writeBlocking`.
* Fixed premature closing of underlying realm of frozen objects returned from `MutableRealm.write/writeBlocking`. (Issue [#477](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/477))

## 0.5.0 (2021-08-20)

### Breaking Changes
* Moved `@PrimaryKey` annotation from `io.realm.PrimaryKey` to `io.realm.annotations.PrimaryKey`.

### Enhancements
* Add support for excluding properties from the Realm schema. This is done by either using JVM `@Transient` or the newly added `@io.realm.kotlin.Ignore` annotation. (Issue [#278](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/278)).
* Add support for encrypted Realms. Encryption can be enabled by passing a 64-byte encryption key to the configuration builder. (Issue [#227](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/227))
* Add support for `RealmList` notifications using Kotlin `Flow`s. (Issue [#359](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/359))
* Unmanaged `RealmObject`s can now be added directly to `RealmList`s without having to copy them to Realm beforehand.

### Fixed
* Throw exception when violating primary key uniqueness constraint when importing objects with `copyToRealm`.
* Fix crash caused by premature release of frozen versions (`java.lang.RuntimeException: [18]: Access to invalidated Results objects`)
* Fix optimizations bypassing our custom getter and setter from within a class (Issue [#375](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/375)).

### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.21 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal

## 0.4.0 (2021-07-13)

This release contains a big departure in the architectural design of how Realm is currently implemented. At a high level it moves from "Thread-confined, Live Objects" to "Frozen Objects". The reasons for this shift are discussed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bGfjbKLD6DSBpTiVwyorSBcMqkUQWedAmmS_VAhL8QU/edit#heading=h.fzlh39twuifc).

At a high level this has a number of implications:

    1. Only one Realm instance (per `RealmConfiguration`) is needed across the entire application.
    2. The only reason for closing the Realm instance is if the Realm file itself needs to be deleted or compacted.
    3. Realm objects can be freely moved and read across threads.
    4. Changes to objects can only be observed through Kotlin Flows. Standard change listener support will come in a future release.
    5. In order to modify Realm Objects, they need to be "live". It is possible to convert a frozen object to a live object inside a
       write transaction using the `MutableRealm.findLatest(obj)` API. Live objects are not accessible outside write transactions.

This new architecture is intended to make it easier to consume and work with Realm, but at the same time, it also introduces a few caveats:

    1. Storing a strong reference to a Realm Object can cause an issue known as "Version pinning". Realm tracks the "distance" between the oldest known version and the latest. So if you store a reference for too long, when other writes are happening, Realm might run out of native memory and crash, or it can lead to an increased file size. It is possible to detect this problem by setting `RealmConfiguration.Builder.maxNumberOfActiveVersions()`. It can be worked around by copying the data out of the Realm and store that instead.

    2. With multiple versions being accessible across threads, it is possible to accidentally compare data from different versions. This could be a potential problem for certain business logic if two objects do not agree on a particular state. If you suspect this is an issue, a `version()` method has been added to all Realm Objects, so it can be inspected for debugging. Previously, Realms thread-confined objects guaranteed this would not happen.

    3. Since the threading model has changed, there is no longer a guarantee that running the same query twice in a row will return the same result. E.g. if a background write is executed between them, the result might change. Previously, this would have resulted in the same result as the Realm state for a particular thread would only update as part of the event loop.


### Breaking Changes
* The Realm instance itself is now thread safe and can be accessed from any thread.
* Objects queried outside write transactions are now frozen by default and can be freely read from any thread.
* As a consequence of the above, when a change listener fires, the changed data can only be observed in the new object received, not in the original, which was possible before this release.
* Removed `Realm.open(configuration: RealmConfiguration)`. Use the interchangeable `Realm(configuration: RealmConfiguration)`-constructor instead.
* Removed all `MutableRealm.create(...)`-variants. Use `MutableRealm.copyToRealm(instance: T): T` instead.

### Enhancements
* A `version()` method has been added to `Realm`, `RealmResults` and `RealmObject`. This returns the version of the data contained. New versions are obtained by observing changes to the object.
* `Realm.observe()`, `RealmResults.observe()` and `RealmObject.observe()` have been added and expose a Flow of updates to the object.
* Add support for suspending writes executed on the Realm Write Dispatcher with `suspend fun <R> write(block: MutableRealm.() -> R): R`
* Add support for setting background write and notification dispatchers with `RealmConfigruation.Builder.notificationDispatcher(dispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher)` and `RealmConfiguration.Builder.writeDispatcher(dispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher)`
* Add support for retrieving the latest version of an object inside a write transaction with `<T : RealmObject> MutableRealm.findLatests(obj: T?): T?`

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal
* Updated `com.gradle.plugin-publish` to 0.15.0.
* Updated to Realm Core commit: 4cf63d689ba099057345f122265cbb880a8eb19d.
* Updated to Android NDK: 22.1.7171670.
* Introduced usage of `kotlinx.atomicfu`: 0.16.1.


## 0.3.2 (2021-07-06)

### Breaking Changes
* None.

### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* [Bug](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/334) in `copyToRealm` causing a `RealmList` not to be saved as part of the model.

### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal
* None.


## 0.3.1 (2021-07-02)

### Breaking Changes
* None.

### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* Android Release build variant (AAR) was stripped from all classes due to presence of `isMinifyEnabled` flag in the library module. The flag is removed now.


### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal
* None.


## 0.3.0 (2021-07-01)

### Breaking Changes
* None.

### Enhancements
* [Support Apple Release builds](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/142).
* Enabling [shrinker](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/293) for Android Release builds.
* Added support for `RealmList` as supported field in model classes. A `RealmList` is used to model one-to-many relationships in a Realm object.
* Schema migration is handled automatically when adding or removing a property or class to the model without specifying a `schemaVersion`.
If a class or column is renamed you need to set a greater `schemaVersion` to migrate the Realm (note: currently renaming will not copy data to the new column). Alternatively `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` could be set to (without setting `schemaVersion`) to delete the Realm file if an automatic migration is not possible. Fixes [#284](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/284).

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal
* None.


## 0.2.0 (2021-06-09)

### Enhancements
* The Realm Kotlin Gradle plugin is now available on Gradle Plugin Portal and can be used with the Plugin DSL and `gradlePluginPortal()` as the buildscript repository. A minimal setup of using this approach can be found [here](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.realm.kotlin).

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* This release is compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10 and Coroutines 1.5.0.

### Internal
* Updated to Realm Core commit: ed9fbb907e0b5e97e0e2d5b8efdc0951b2eb980c.

    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
    	mavenCentral()
    }
}

// Project build.gradle file
